# Computational Intelligence - UFES

This repository was created as a form of study for the Computational Intelligence discipline at UFES, taught by professor Renato Krohling.

In this repository, I sought to minimize the equations proposed in the article ["Swarm algorithms with chaotic jumps applied to noisy optimization problems" by Mendel, Krohling and Campos (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2010.06.007) using algorithms studied in the classroom such as Binary Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization.
